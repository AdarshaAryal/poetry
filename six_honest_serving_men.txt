From the Indians who welcomed the pilgrims
  And to the buffalos who once ruled the plain
Like the vultures circling beneath the dark clouds
  Looking for the rain
  Looking for the rain
Just like the cities staggered on the coastline
  In a nation that just can't stand much more
Like the forest buried beneath the highway
